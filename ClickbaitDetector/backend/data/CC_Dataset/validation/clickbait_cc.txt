25 things you still don't know about Barack Obama How well do you know No. 44? He's left-handed. He's quite capable of being his own anger translator. He eats (but does not ration) almonds. He's a binge-watcher. He's a big iPad guy. He's a prospective Chevy Volt owner. He's the 11th president to be raised without a father. He's "pretty terrible" at March Madness brackets. His favorite song of 2015 was Kendrick Lamar's "How Much a Dollar Cost." He read Harry Potter books with his eldest daughter. He's probably the biggest "Star Trek" fan in White House history. He's got more Grammys than Tupac, Biggie and The Who combined. He saw "Hamilton" in previews. As of his 55th birthday, his net worth was a reported $12.2 million. His favorite movies are "The Godfather" and "The Godfather: Part II." He reveres the original GOP standard-bearer. He signed up for an Obamacare plan. He's practically Mike Pence's next-door neighbor. His favorite place to hang in the White House is the Truman Balcony. His all-time favorite all-American invention is the lightbulb. He's a II, as in "Jaws II." His family's No. 1 charity serves vets and their families. He is a Christian who was born in the United States. His old apartment in Pasadena, Calif., is something of a landmark. He writes a lot of letters.
